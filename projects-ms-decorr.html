Building on the experiments performed for the project:

<a href="projects-ms-fractal.html">Time-Evolution of a Fractal Distribution: 
Particle Concentrations in Free-Surface Turbulence</a>

and

<a href="projects-ms-stats.html">Power-law distributions of particle concentration in free-surface flows</a>,

we studied the effect of spatial and temporal correlation of the flow field on the 
resulting particle concentration field.

In Figure (a, correlated) above, the trajectories of the particles are generated using the  velocity fields in the order they were taken experimentally. In Figure (b, decorrealted), the velocity sequence is randomly shuffled in time to generate new trajectories. This analysis
mimics the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraichnan">Kraichnan</a> ensemble and yields properties of a velocity 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_function">correlation function</a>  that is 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">delta correlated</a> 
in time but not in space.

Certain aspects of the particle motion and topology
are retained in the temporally decorrelated field.
The topology of the decorrelated floaters is stringlike, just
as in the correlated case.
The 
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InformationDimension.html">fractal information dimension D1</a> remains close to unity, at least
at small spatial scales where this parameter is defined. On 
large scales, temporal decorrelation truncates the length of 
the stringlike structures, as seen in the above Figure (b). 
The present measurements show that D1 is measurably altered by 
the temporal randomization, but at small scales the particle 
distribution retains its string-like character. 

<p>
Turbulence is especially difficult to understand because
the velocity fluctuations, which lie at its heart, are chaotic in
both space and time, with very many degrees of freedom
being excited. The phenomenon is especially intractable
when viewed in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field">Eulerian frame</a>, 
where the small-scale
velocity fluctuations are contained in and moved about by  
eddies of larger size.
In an effort to capture the essence of turbulence Kraichnan 
proposed that the problem is more easily understood in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field">Lagrangian frame</a>, where large-scale eddy effects are absent. 
To effect further simplification, Kraichnan proposed that the temporal 
velocity fluctuations be approximated as delta correalted, as in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>. 
The measurements reported here suggest that our understanding of 
turbulence can be enhanced by comparing and contrasting correlated 
and temporally decorrelated flows.
