Particles floating on the surface of a turbulent incompressible fluid accumulate along string-like structures,
while leaving large regions of the flow domain empty. This is reflected experimentally by a very peaked
probability distribution function of cr, the coarse-grained particle concentration at scale r, around cr = 0, with a
−␤r
. The positive exponent ␤r decreases with scale in the
power-law decay over two decades of cr, ⌸͑cr͒ κ cr
inertial range and stays approximately constant in the dissipative range, thus, indicating a qualitative difference
between the dissipative and the inertial ranges of scales, also visible in the first moment of cr.

FIG. 1. ͑Color online͒ Top panel: visualization of the steady-
state particle distribution shows string-like coagulations surrounded
by ͑relatively͒ depleted regions. Bottom panel: the Eulerian concen-
tration field nr in the steady state shows a very intermittent distri-
bution, with very large spikes concentrated along string-like struc-
tures, surrounded by vast depleted regions which are nearly flat.
The x and y axis are in units of ␩ ͑see text͒. The coarse-graining
scale chosen here is r = 3.4. Decreasing the coarse-graining scale r
increases the intermittent nature of the particle concentration.

FIG. 3. ͑Color online͒ Top panel: ⌸͑cr͒ in the dissipative range
r Շ 3. The PDFs of the concentration, scaled by its mean value ͗cr͘
exhibit a power-law distribution at low value of cr / ͗cr͘:
⌸͑x͒ κ x−␤ with ␤ Ϸ 0.8Ϯ 0.05. The PDFs decay faster than algebra-
ically for cr / ͗cr͘ տ 1. Bottom panel: ⌸͑cr͒ in the inertial range
r տ 5. The PDFs in the inertial range also exhibit a power-law dis-
tribution at low value of cr / ͗cr͘ greater than the PDF’s maximum:
−␤r
⌸͑cr͒ κ cr
whose exponent ␤r decreases when r increases. Here,
␤r Ӎ 0.5 at r = 28.6 and increases to ␤r Ӎ 0.75 at r = 5.0 The decay of
the PDF at large values of cr / ͗cr͘ տ 1 is faster than algebraic,
clearly seen for r = 7.9 and 5.0. The PDFs in the inertial range have
been shifted vertically to better see the evolution of the power-law
region.
