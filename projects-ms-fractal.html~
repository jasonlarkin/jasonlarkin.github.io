In this experiment we study the transient evolution of a
fractal topology in a laboratory setting, namely, the clustering 
of floating particles at the surface of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence">turbulent fluid</a>.
If neutrally bouyant, non-inertial particles are introduced
into a turbulent flow, they quickly distribute themselves
throughout the volume of the fluid; further stirring leaves
the particle density distribution uniform. The bouyant par-
ticles used in this experiment have a density much less than
that of the fluid on which they move. Hence their behavior is 
entirely different. Now, their motion is confined to
the surface of the turbulent fluid.

horizontally on the tank floor (shown as randomly oriented Z-shaped
patterns) that pump water into the tank re-circulated by a 8hp
pump. The central region of the water surface is illuminated by a
laser-sheet. A high-speed digital camera suspended vertically above
this central region captures images of the light scattered by buoyant
particles (50 μm hollow-glass spheres of specific gravity 0.25).

Steady-state turbulence is generated in a tank of water and the trajectories of particles forming a compressible system on the surface
are tracked in time. The initial uniformly distributed floating particles coagulate and form a fractal distribution, a rare manifestation
of a fractal object observable in real-space. The surface pattern reaches a steady state in approximately 1 s. Measurements are
made of the fractal dimensions Dq (t) (q = 1 to 6) of the floating particles starting with the uniform distribution Dq (0) = 2 for
Taylor Microscale Reynolds number Reλ ≃ 160. Focus is on the the time-evolution of the correlation dimension D2 (t) as the steady
state is approached. This steady state is reached in several large eddy turnover times and does so at an exponential rate.

When studying a dynamical system in phase space, one
of several scenarios may occur. The simplest cases involve
either a fixed point or a limit cycle (periodic orbit). The
most interesting scenario unfolds when studying dissipative
systems undergoing chaotic evolution. When a system is
driven out of thermal equilibrium, a phase point which pre-
viously would have visited all regions of phase space with
almost equal probability, now spends most of its time in a
limited region. There it develops a complex fractal topol-
ogy with a non-trivial fractal dimension [13]. Fractal di-
mensions have been measured extensively for simple maps
(eg. the Henon map) [1,6] as well as for real world systems
[2]. Typically, the fractal behavior of such systems is stud-
ied in an asymptotic limit which ignores the transient be-
havior [1]. In this paper, we show that measuring a fractal
dimension in the transient state is an effective way to char-
acterize the evolving topology of this particular system.

The 1 m × 1 m tank is filled with water to a height of 
 30cm. The tank is large compared to the camera’s field of 
   view. The turbulence is generated by a large pump con- 
   nected to a network of rotating jets in a plane 10 cm above 
   the tank floor. See Figure 2 for a schematic of the experi- 
   mental setup. The arrangement creates uniform turbulence 
   in the center of the tank, and also moves the source of tur- 
   bulent injection far from the fluid surface where the mea- 
   surements are made [18]. With this scheme, surface waves, 
   which cannot be avoided, do not exceed an amplitude of 
   ∼1 mm [18]. It is necessary that the surface of the tank 
     be freshly cleaned before each set of measurements. Oth- 
     erwise, amphiphiles form a continuous layer on the surface 
     and prevents the floaters from moving freely under the ac- 
     tion of the turbulence [18]. 
     The hydrophillic particles chosen here are subject to cap- 
     illary forces which are very small compared to forces com- 
     ing from the turbulence, and do not affect the results as 
     they do in [36,37]. The non-inertial character of the parti- 
     cles is minimal because the Stokes number St is small: St = 
     τs vrms /a ≃ 0.01, where a is the particle radius, vrms is the 
        RMS velocity of the turbulent fluid at the free-surface, and 
        τs is the stopping time of the particle [38]. 
         During an experimental run, the floating particles (50μm 
          diameter and specific gravity of 0.25) are constantly seeded 
          into the fluid from the tank floor, where they undergo tur- 
          bulent mixing as they rise due to buoyancy and are uni- 
          formly dispersed by the time they rise to the surface. Once 
          at the free-surface, their motion is constrained to the two- 
          dimensional surface plane. Their motion is tracked via a 
          high-speed camera (Phantom v.5) situated above the tank. 
          The camera field-of-view is a square area of side length L = 
          9cm. The constant particle injection is necessary to replace 
          particles at the surface during the experiment. The source 
          and sink structure at the surface fluctuates in both time 
          and space, which can cause particles to leave the camera’s 
            field of view. 
            Instantaneous velocity fields are measured using an in- 
            house developed particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) pro- 
            gram which processes the recorded images of the floaters. 
            The constant injection of particles ensures that surface 
            sources and sinks receive an adequate coverage of particles 
            on the surface. The local particle density at the surface de- 
            termines the average spacing of the velocity vector fields 
            produced by the PIV program. The resulting velocity vec- 
            tors are spaced (on average) by δx = 2.5 η over both sources 
              and sinks. This vector grid spacing is important for the La- 
              grangian particle evolution scheme, which is discussed be- 
              low. The camera’s height above the water surface was cho- 
                sen so that a pixel size is roughly 0.1mm, comparable to 
                the dissipative scale of the turbulence.

The transient evolution of the floaters is studied by uniformly distributing 
the floaters at t = 0. At times t > 0 the particles are subject to the 
underlying turbulent flow until their spatial distribution reaches a
steady state. To study the floater’s fractal distribution, the
spectrum of fractal dimensions Dq (t) is measured at subse-
quent times t during the transient evolution. One may argue that 
the generalized fractal dimensions Dq of any system are meaningful 
only in the limit of the evolution time t → ∞. However, there exist instances 
of fractal objects realizable in real or configuration space (such as shear flows
[35], cement gels [31], and [17]) that are amenable to inves-
tigation of their transient behavior.

It is essential to realize that the floaters in this exper-
ment are passively advected by the underlying flow. They
are small enough to follow the velocity field of the turbulent
sea on which they move, in a plane that has coordinates x,
y, z = 0. There are, of course, waves on the surface, and
they can drive the motion of the floaters. Separate studies
have shown that the amplitude of the surface waves is small
enough to have a negligible effect on the particle motion
[18]. Though the water molecules can have a downward ve-
locity component at all values of the depth z, the floaters
cannot follow them. That is why they coagulate and dis-
perse in the plane of their motion x, y with z = 0. In this
sense the floaters form a strongly compressible system.

If the spatial distribution is initially uniform at t = 0, continuous stirring
of the underlying fluid evolves this spatial distribution into
string-like structures. Ultimately a steady state is reached,
at which time the floaters occupy a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension">fractal dimension</a> much
less than 2. This time evolution into a fractal is a generic
effect. It occurs even if the interactions between the floaters
is negligibly small. A common manifestation of this phenomenon is the coagulation 
of scum on the surface of the sea, as is often seen in an ocean harbor.

<p>
Range of values of the fractal dimension D<sub>q</sub> are measured for various times
in the experiment. These results indicate a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifractal_system">multi-fractal</a> 
distribution of the particles for the inertial range of the flow after the particles 
evolve from a homogeneous one at t = 0 s.

A compressible system of particles in free-surface turbulence 
represents an instance of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor">chaotic attractor</a> 
in real space. The system evolves in a time of the order of the
lifetime of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_eddy_simulation">largest eddies</a>, 
to a steady state where the
measured D<sub>q</sub>(t) approach a value that is slightly greater
than 1, implying the formation of string-like structures. The
correlation dimension D<sub>2</sub>(t) evolves exponentially as the
steady state is approached. It is not possible, so far, to deduce 
these observations from the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes equations</a>
in the inertial range of the compressible flow studied here.
